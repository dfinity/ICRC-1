# Ledger & Tokenization Working Group Charters

## 2022-08-02

Slides: TBD

Decisions made:

  * Follow up on #32: rename `Account.principal` â†’ `Account.owner` (implemented in https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/pull/41).

    Rationale: "principal" is a reserved identifier in Candid, using this identified can create unnecessary complication when calling the ledger from the command line.

  * `icrc1_minting_account` (proposed in https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/pull/29): make the result optional: `icrc1_minting_account : () -> (opt Account) query`.

    Add related metadata entries when we have a text representation for `Account`.

  * Structural deduplication (proposed in https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/pull/24): accepted.

  * `icrc1_fee` (suggested in https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/issues/30, proposed in https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/pull/33): accepted

  * Larger memos (suggested in https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/issues/30, proposed in https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/pull/38): accepted

  * TransferError type (questioned in https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/issues/30, proposed in https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/pull/43):

    - Add another variant like `Overloaded` or `Throttled` to cover a recoverable error indicating that the ledger is overloaded.

    - Remove the window from `TooOld`.

    - Add the current ledger time to `CreatedInFuture` variant.
